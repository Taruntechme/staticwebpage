       <p><strong>D-Dos Attack</strong><br>A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a critical attempt to make upset typical internet traffic of a targeted <strong>server</strong> by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. A DDoS attack is similar to a traffic jam on a highway, preventing typical traffic flow..<br></p>
       <p>A DDoS attack requires the attacker to gain control of a network of online machines. Computers are infected with malware, turning them into a bot. Then, the <strong>attacker</strong> has control over the group of bots, now called a botnet.
        Once a botnet is established, the attacker will send instructions to each bot from a remote control. Once the IP address is targeted, each bot will respond by sending requests to the target, causing the server to overflow.</p>

       <h><strong style="align-content: center; font-size: 14" >How can DDoS attacks?</strong><br></h>
            <p>If you are facing an isolated low- to mid-size <strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)</strong> attack, you just need to learn about top digital attack information from cybersecurity incidents around the world, where would you look? You can try internet service provider (ISP)’s stats or check out anti-DDOS providers, or you can see what’s happening right now by looking at digital attack maps.
            To see how cybersecurity works globally, you can observe cyber-attacks and how malicious packets interact between countries. We are going to share with you the top cyber-attack maps that you can watch in order to visualize digital threat incidents. 
            Distributed denial-of-service attacks target websites and online services. The aim is to overwhelm them with more traffic than the server or network can accommodate. The goal is to render the website or service inoperable.

            The traffic can consist of incoming messages, requests for connections, or fake packets. In some cases, the targeted victims are threatened with a DDoS attack or attacked at a low level. This may be combined with an extortion threat of a more devastating attack unless the company pays a cryptocurrency ransom. In 2015 and 2016, a criminal group called the <strong>Armada</strong> Collective repeatedly extorted banks, web host providers, and others in this way.<br></p>
            
            <h><strong>Examples of DDoS attacks</strong><br></h>
            
            Here’s a bit of <strong>history</strong> and two notable attacks.

            <p>In 2000, Michael Calce, a 15-year-old boy who used the online name “Mafiaboy,” launched one of the first recorded DDoS attacks. Calce hacked into the computer networks of a number of universities. He used their servers to operate a DDoS attack that crashed several major websites, including CNN, E-Trade, eBay, and Yahoo. Calce was convicted of his crimes in the Montreal Youth Court. As an adult, he became a “white-hat hacker” identifying vulnerabilities in the computer systems of major companies.<br></p>

            <p>More recently, in 2016, Dyn, a major domain name system provider — or DNS — was hit with a massive DDoS attack that took down major websites and services, including AirBnB, CNN, Netflix, PayPal, Spotify, Visa, Amazon, The New York Times, Reddit, and GitHub.<br></p>

            <p>The gaming industry has also been a target of DDoS attacks, along with software and media companies.<br></p>

            <p>DDoS attacks are sometimes done to divert the attention of the target organization. While the target organization focuses on the DDoS attack, the cybercriminal may pursue a primary motivation such as installing malicious software or stealing data.<br></p>

            <p>DDoS attacks have been used as a weapon of choice of hacktivists, profit-motivated cybercriminals, nation states and even — particularly in the early years of DDoS attacks — computer whizzes seeking to make a grand gesture.<br></p>
